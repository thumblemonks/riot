module Riot

  # A Reporter decides how to output the result of a test. When a context is set to be executed, the
  # {Riot::Reporter#describe_context} method is called with the context that will be running; this remains
  # so until the next context is executed. After each {Riot::AssertionMacro#evaluate assertion is evaluated}, 
  # {Riot::Reporter#report} is called with the description of the assertion and the resulting response.
  #
  # The general idea is that a sub-class of Reporter should be defined that knows specifically how to
  # output the reported results. In the sub-class, you simply need to implement a +pass+, +fail+, +error+,
  # and +results+ method.
